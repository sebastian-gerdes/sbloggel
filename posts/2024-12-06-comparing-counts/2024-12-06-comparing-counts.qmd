## Description of problem

* Two random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ with realiziations $x_1$ and $x_2$, each following a Poisson distribution with rates $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$
* Null hypothesis: $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2$

## Approximate, naive test
We can construct an approximate, pragmatic statistical test. The test statistic $k = x_2 - x_1$ follows approximately (asymptotically with growing $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$) a normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{x_1 + x_2}$.
```{r}
x_1 <- 1500
x_2 <- 1600
k <- x_1 - x_2
sigma <- sqrt(x_1 + x_2)
(p_value <- 2 * pnorm(k, mean = 0, sd = sigma))
```

## Exact test
`R` offers an exact test. 
```{r}
poisson.test(c(x_1, x_2))
```

## Conclusion
It may be surprising -- but measurement of two counts for different conditions can be enough in order to test for equality of event rates.
