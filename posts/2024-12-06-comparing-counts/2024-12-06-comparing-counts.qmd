## Situation

* Two random variables $X_1$ and $X_2$ with realiziations $x_1$ and $x_2$, each following a Poisson distribution with rates $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$
* Null hypothesis: $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2$

## Approximate, naive test
Very approximate, pragmatic statistical test: 

* Test statistic $k = x_2 - x_1$ follows approximately (asymptotically with growing $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$) a normal distribution with $\mu = 0$ and $\sigma = \sqrt{x_1 + x_2}$
```{r}
x_1 <- 150
x_2 <- 160
k <- x_1 - x_2
sigma <- sqrt(x_1 + x_2)
(p_value <- 2 * pnorm(k, mean = 0, sd = sigma))
```

## Exact test
```{r}
poisson.test(c(x_1, x_2))
```
