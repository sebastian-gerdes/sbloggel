In order to save output from within `R`, the `sink` commmand usually can do the job. Have a look also at the help page.

To save all output:
```{r}
#! eval: false
zz <- file("all.Rout", open = "wt")
sink(zz)
sink(zz, type = "message")
print(1:10)
# stop('An eror is an error!')
warning('A warning is a warning!')
sink(type = "message")
sink()
file.show("all.Rout")
```
