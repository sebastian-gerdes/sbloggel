How much water in liters is removed from a flat with a volume if the air in the flat is changed?
```{r}
# devtools::install_github("sebastian-gerdes/smisc")
library('smisc')
diff_water(temperature_out = 8, 
           relative_humidity_outside = 80, 
           temperature_inside = 20, 
           relative_humidity_inside = 70, 
           volume = 300)
```
