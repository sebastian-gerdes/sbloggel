## Possible concepts:

* Model of research environment (e. g. university hospital) and simulate a lot of studies in this environment
* Continue Elena's work
* Use clinicaltrials.gov data set as training dataset for neural net
* Simulate a lot of studies in [this](/posts/2023-08-21-algorithmic-study-design----white-paper/2023-08-21-algorithmic-study-design----white-paper.qmd) manner

## Further ideas:

* We could start with a descriptive analysis of the clinicaltrials.gov database
* There are some older papers
