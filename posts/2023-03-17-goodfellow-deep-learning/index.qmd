## Linear Algebra
## Probability and Information Theory
* "Researchers have made compelling arguments for quantifying uncertainty using probability since at least the 1980s."
* Three sources of uncertainty:
  * Inherent stochasticity (e. g. quantum mechanics, card shuffling)
  * Incomplete observability (e. g. Monty hall problem)
  * Incomplete modeling
* Probability of used as degree of belief

### Random variables (3.2)
* notation: 
  * random variable: plain typeface
  * values it can take with lowerscript letters
  * vector-valued: bold

### Probability distribution (3.3)
* discrete variables: probability mass function (notation: usually $P$)
* notation: $x \sim P(x)$
